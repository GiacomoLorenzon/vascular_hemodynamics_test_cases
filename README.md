## Content
This repository contains the example files needed to run some test cases for the
1D simulation of the hemodynamics in a vessels network.
Those files are supposed to be used within the **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**
(/,laɪfˈɛks/) library.

## Tests list
The available tests are:
+ Single vessel;
+ Single vessel with stent implant;
+ Single vessel with stent implant and adaptive mesh;
+ Bifurcation of a single vessel;
+ Small vessels network.
