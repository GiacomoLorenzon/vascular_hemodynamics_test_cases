## Content
This repository contains the example files needed to run some test cases for the
1D simulation of the hemodynamics in a vessels network.
Those files are supposed to be used within the **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**
(/,laɪfˈɛks/) library.

## Tests list
The available tests are:
1. Single vessel;
2. Single vessel with stent implant;
3. Single vessel with stent implant and adaptive mesh;
4. Bifurcation of a single vessel;
5. Small vessels network.

Each folder contains two subfolders: **data** has in it the input files,
whereas **results** stores the output of those very same simulations.

## Get the software
To download, install or use **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**, please refer to
